# Pole-Balance
Implementing Reinforcement-Learning in Gym-Environment


## Getting Started
 - Donwloand libraries
 - Install gym
 - Run File with Jupyter
 
## Result
 - Training very unstable, high peaks followed by low performance phases
 - Model is saved after good result (Time > 500)
 - Tes shows that good result is reproducible
 
 

## Credits:
Based on this Github [Link](https://github.com/keon/deep-q-learning)
 - Some modifications of model
 - Attaching rendering function and saving routine 
 - Swicht-off GPU-function
